<problem statement>

### Background
In recent years, the rapid exchange of information has underscored significant technological deficiencies that impact people's lives. The proliferation of social media has accelerated the spread of misinformation by malicious actors worldwide. Our group aims to address this challenge by leveraging Machine Learning principles acquired in our coursework to develop a solution. Our project emerged from discussions with friends and peers, heightening our awareness of the issue. Historical and contemporary instances demonstrate how misinformation can incite chaos and even cost lives. Ultimately, our group seeks to promote peace and stability by employing Machine Learning to distinguish between fake and genuine news.
