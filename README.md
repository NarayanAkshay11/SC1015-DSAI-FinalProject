# SC1015-DSAI-FinalProject
### Fake News Detection using NLP, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
## Problem Statement
Our project focuses on creating a comprehensive analysis framework to classify news articles as either genuine or fake. Leveraging features such as keywords, subject matter, and country of origin, we aim to build models capable of accurately determining the truthfulness index of news articles on a scale of 1 to 5. The goal is to provide a tool for combating misinformation and promoting the dissemination of accurate information in the digital landscape. We will be looking at data largely based in North America & India.

## Background
In recent years, the rapid exchange of information has underscored significant technological deficiencies that impact people's lives. The proliferation of social media has accelerated the spread of misinformation by malicious actors worldwide. Our group aims to address this challenge by leveraging Machine Learning principles acquired in our coursework to develop a solution. Our project emerged from discussions with friends and peers, heightening our awareness of the issue. Historical and contemporary instances demonstrate how misinformation can incite chaos and even cost lives. Ultimately, our group seeks to promote peace and stability by employing Machine Learning to distinguish between fake and genuine news.
Our motivation stems from the urgent need to address the rampant spread of misinformation in news articles. In today's digital age, fake news undermines public trust, distorts factual information, and leads to societal harm. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a solution that accurately identifies fake news, empowering individuals and organizations to make informed decisions and combat the spread of misinformation.
